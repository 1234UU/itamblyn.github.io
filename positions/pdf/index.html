Our group (http://clean.energyscience.ca) seeks a postdoctoral fellow for a project linking deep neural networks with electronic structure theory. So far, we have shown that deep networks can be used to solve the Schrodinger Equation (https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.96.042113), classical spin models (https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.96.042113), and 2d-materials such as graphene and boron-nitride (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927025618301526).

The project will explore the use of our recently reported extensive deep neural networks (EDNN, https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06686) to the electronic structure problem within the density functional theory. The objective is to show that EDNN can outperform "traditional" electronic structure methods by a factor of 1,000,000. We will generate predictive results 1000 times faster than is currently possible and work on problems 1000 times larger than can currently be modelled.
