<h3>Accelerated electronic structure with deep learning</h3>

<p>Our group (<a href="http://clean.energyscience.ca">CLEAN@NRC</a>) seeks a postdoctoral fellow for a project linking deep neural networks with electronic structure theory. So far, we have shown that deep networks can be used to solve the Schrodinger Equation (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.96.042113">https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.96.042113</a>), classical spin models (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.97.032119">https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.97.032119</a>), and 2d-materials such as graphene and boron-nitride (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.03.005">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.03.005</a>).

<p>The project will explore the use of our recently reported extensive deep neural networks (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06686">https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06686</a>) to the electronic structure problem within the density functional theory. The objective is to show that EDNN can outperform "traditional" electronic structure methods by a factor of 1,000,000. We will generate predictive results 1000 times faster than is currently possible and work on problems 1000 times larger than can currently be modelled.

<p>Salary = $65,000 CAD / year for two years + relocation allowance + conference travel allowance

<p>Location = Ottawa, Ontario, Canada

<p>Coffee = free
<p>Contact isaac.tamblyn@nrc.ca

<p>Applicants should provide a CV, Statement of Interest, and contact information for 3 references

<p>Application deadline = 10 May 2018
