<p>== CLEAN@NRC ==

<p>Our <a href="http://clean.energyscience.ca">group</a> seeks a postdoctoral fellow for a project linking deep neural networks with electronic structure theory. So far, we have shown that deep networks can be used to solve the <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.96.042113">Schrodinger Equation</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09779">classical spin models</a>, and 2d-materials such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09496">graphene and boron-nitride</a>.

<p>The project will explore the use of our recently reported <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06686">extensive deep neural networks</a> to the electronic structure problem within the density functional theory. The objective is to show that EDNN can outperform "traditional" electronic structure methods by a factor of 1,000,000. We will generate predictive results 1000 times faster than is currently possible and work on problems 1000 times larger than can currently be modelled.

<p>Salary = $65,000 CAD / year for two years + relocation allowance + conference travel allowance
<p>Location = Ottawa, Ontario, Canada
<p>Coffee = free

<!--<p>Candidates should have obtained a PhD (or equivalent) within the past three years (PhD received on or after July 1, 2015) or expect to complete their PhD by September, 2018.
